Contemplative tourism??

The notion of going into retreat has a strangely alluring and seductively problematic quality to it, from a scholarly perspective. On the one hand, we have theories of Western linear progression that understand any notion of admission of weakness as not simply troubling for the individual, but something symbolic of a more problematic dimension of individual character. That you would even need to 'take time out' signals weakness, inconsistency, and lack of a coherent narrative.

On the other hand, we have in operation a consumerist cycle in which touristic acquisition - of experiences, sights, souvenirs - is valourised, and within this, indeed part of the complex raisons d'etre of tourism, is the notion of being re-created by our leave. We take recreational leave to 'have time off', to recuperate from the stresses of our normal working lives. A subset of this latter social force involves quite a radical departure from what is normal, at least symbolically and substantively, in which we see individuals and groups depart everyday for

structurally, symbolically, and substantively opposite to the typical content of everyday life. Curiously, however, in the case of retreat tourism (dare I neologise it as 'contemplative tourism already?) we also see that these acts of retreat are, in fact, constructed as apposite to the 'authentic' inner concerns of individuals pulled and pushed in ways 'not themselves' in the course of daily life.
