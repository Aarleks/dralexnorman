summary: More about my current research interests

---

I am generally interested in how humans construct meaning, purpose, and identity for themselves, both as individuals and as social groups, and how this affects habitus and social interactions. This includes understanding the forces that might hinder or enable that kind of work, as well as their socio-historical antecedents. Sociology, as the great C. Wright Mills contended, is the business of understanding the admixture of history and biography.


# Meditation Retreat Practices

In my current role I am a member of the Shamatha Project research team, lead by Clifford Saron. The Shamatha Project isÂ a longitudinal multidisciplinary study examining biological, physiological, and cognitive effects of participation in two three-month intensive Buddhist meditation retreats (experiement and waitlist control). There have been some very interesting findings out of the project, including that participants showed improvements in perceptual sensitivity and response inhibition. Most curiously, for me at least, participants showed increased telomerase activity compared to controls, and that this activity was related to changes in well-being as measured by self-report questionnaires.

Within this larger project I have a couple of sub-projects going on:
* Network analysis of codes attached to qualitative data</li>
* Systematising anlysis of in-depth semi-structured interview data in order to produce transparency and code agreement/validity narrative products

# Spiritual Tourism

I call tourism that is characterised and/or understood as being about meaning, purpose, and identity 'spiritual tourism'. While this might clearly have overlaps with other forms of tourism (history or roots tourism, for example) and with traditions of travel that people may take part in (often called 'pilgrimage'), spiritual tourism is mainly about the self, and probably is most useful when describing and analysing the travel practices of those who might characterise themselves as 'spiritual but not religious'. My research on this subject, looked at instances in which people engaged with religious practices without necessarily claiming belonging or belief (nodding to Grace Davie) in their generating traditions.

Following from my monograph, <em><a href="http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/spiritual-tourism-9781472514615/" target="_blank">Spiritual Tourism</a></em>, and a follow-up <a href="http://openjournals.library.usyd.edu.au/index.php/LA/article/download/7573/7905" target="_blank">journal article</a> I wrote, I think there are some important gaps in scholarship and questions that require attention. These include: ethnographic work on the incidence of spiritual touristic practices at sites around the world; critical analysis of discourse by and about spiritual tourists, particularly concerning the issue of cultural appropriation for self-benefit; discussion of the prudential values of touristic practices that are about self-work; and investigation of the well-being outcomes of the various spiritual touristic practices.

#New Religions and Travel

All religious movements produce traditions of travel (sometimes called pilgrimages), either deliberately or spontaneously. I am interested in how religious movements and groups that are 'new' in some respect produce, justify, and maintain practices that involve acts of travel by participants. I am particularly interested in how and why groups choose locations and construe the meaning of travel acts. These may range from the pragmatic ('we happen to own this land') to deliberate (the land is intrinsically valued), and can be about potential experience or learning outcomes, or conceived as having actual non-empirical consequences.
