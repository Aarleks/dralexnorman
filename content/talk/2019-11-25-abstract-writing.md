abstract: "Many higher degree research students have to write abstracts for thesis proposals, journal articles, and conference presentations as part of their candidature. While there is a wealth of advice about writing, both in the humanities and the sciences, the steps required to produce a well-written abstract can be difficult to find. This workshop presents information about abstract writing and puts it into a 'function-based' framework that students can use to develop their writing skills. This framework helps students see abstract writing as a step-wise procedure, and helps them to write abstracts that are useful for readers."
