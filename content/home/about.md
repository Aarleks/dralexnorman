# About me

I am an academic at Western Sydney University where my primary role is directing the [Master of Research](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/graduate_research_school/grs/courses/master_of_research) programme, and teaching its core units on the sociology of research and on public audience writing. Teaching these units has stoked my long-held interest in how researchers do research, and what forces constrain, enable, and shape research practices and outputs.  

My principle research interests, in addition to the above, revolve around issues of meaning, purpose, and identity related to acts of travel. In other words, I'm interested in why people travel and how doing so affects their sense of who they are. My research often looks at phenomena that are classified as 'religious', and I have an ongoing fascination with contemplative practices (which we might or might not desire to call 'religious' for various reasons), particularly as practices of re-creation and re-callibration. 

Recently, I've developed a love of prgramming for research and teaching. I'm working with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and am learning [Python](https://www.python.org/), and I'm dabbling elsewhere.
