# About me

I am an academic at Western Sydney University where my primary role is directing the [Master of Research](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/graduate_research_school/grs/courses/master_of_research) programme, and teaching its core units on the sociology of research and on public audience writing. It's a challenging and exciting degree that combines cultivation of specialist knowledge in a particular discipline with training in knowledge translation and working across and between research disciplines. It's new, and it takes up most of my time, but I love it. With it, we want to make a contribution to the construction of an intellegent, compassionate society that knows how to learn and what the value of knowledges are, even when not immediately apparent. 

My research interests mainly revolve around issues of meaning, purpose, and identity related to acts of travel. In other words, I'm interested in why people travel and how doing so affects their sense of who they are. For the most part, this my research looks at phenomena that are often classified as 'religious', and I have an ongoing interest in contemplative practices (which we might or might not desire to call 'religious').

Recently, I've also become interested in prgramming for research and teaching. I learned [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/), and I'm dabbling elsewhere.
